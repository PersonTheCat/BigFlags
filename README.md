# BigFlags
An experimental, high performance alternative to BitVec

**Note**: This library was written as an experiment a couple of years ago and has not since been maintained. It was designed for an older verion of Rust and most likely does not follow a number of best practices regarding unsafe code. Its only purpose was to experiment with extremely fast, low memory index flags. Users should be aware that it was never finished and may not be ideal by many standards.
